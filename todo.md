# TODO
- transition between scenes
- menu views and menu system

- enhance alpha texture loading
- enhance opacity for sprites
- see for sf::transformable
- have all alpha parameters passed as sf::Color
- don't forget to write tests when it's useful
- add mouse dragged support


# RESOLVED ISSUES
- update mouseovers when the mouse is moving, but what about if items are moving and not the mouse ?
> answer: call handle_mousemove_events after updating widgets in Engine::update()

# UP TO NOW
+ resolved xml parsing
